Recursion

1. In your own words, what is Recursion?
    Recursion is the concept of a function calling itself, within itself. 
2. Why is it necessary to have a Base Case?
    A base case prevents infinite looping or a never-ending process that could
    occur when a function is calling itself. It is the case that tells the 
    recursion to stop.

Graphs

1. What is a Graph?
    A graph is way of structuring data/objects that are related to one another.
2. How is a Graph different from a Tree?
    A tree is a type of a graph, but the nodes of a tree can only have one parent
    and there can be no loops/complete circuits.
3. Give an example of somthing that would be good to model with a Graph.
    You can graph the relationships of characters in a complex novel or TV show, such as Game of Thrones, where many people are interrelated and there isn't 
    a strict hierarchy.

Sorting

1. Describe in words how the Bubble Sort algorithm works.
    The bubble sort orders by iterating through each item and moving the highest order item to the back each time it iterates.

2. Describe in words how the Merge Sort algorithm works.
    Merge sort works 

3. Describe in words how the Quick Sort algorithm works.

Git Branching

1. Give an instance when you would use git branching.
    You would
2. What is a pull request?
