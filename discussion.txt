Recursion

1. In your own words, what is Recursion?
    Recursion is the concept of a function calling itself, within itself. 
2. Why is it necessary to have a Base Case?
    A base case prevents infinite looping or a never-ending process that could
    occur when a function is calling itself. It is the case that tells the 
    recursion to stop.

Graphs

1. What is a Graph?
    A graph is way of structuring data/objects that are related to one another.
2. How is a Graph different from a Tree?
    A tree is a type of a graph, but the nodes of a tree can only have one parent
    and there can be no loops/complete circuits.
3. Give an example of somthing that would be good to model with a Graph.
    You can graph the relationships of characters in a complex novel or TV show, such as Game of Thrones, where many people are interrelated and there isn't 
    a strict hierarchy.

Performance of Data Structures

Data Structure     |   Index  |  Search  |  Add-R  |  Add-L  |  Pop-L  |  Pop-R  |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Python List/Array       O(1)      O(n)      O(1)       O(n)     O(n)      O(1)

Linked List             O(n)      O(n)      O(n)       O(1)     O(1)      O(n)    **without tail

Doubly-Linked List      O(n)      O(n)      O(1)       O(1)     O(1)      O(1)

Queue (as Array)        x           x       O(1)       x        O(1)      x

Queue (as LL or DLL)    x           x       O(1)       x        O(1)      x

Stack (as Array, LL,
    or DLL)             x           x       O(1)        x       x         O(1)

Deque (as DLL)          x           x       O(1)       O(1)     O(1)      O(1)

Sorting

1. Describe in words how the Bubble Sort algorithm works.
    The bubble sort orders by iterating through each item and moving the highest order item to the back each time it iterates.

2. Describe in words how the Merge Sort algorithm works.
    Merge sort works by taking 2 already sorted objects, taking the first element in each and comparing which is lower, then adding the lowest order item to a new, third list in ascending order. 

3. Describe in words how the Quick Sort algorithm works.
    Quicksort works by taking a random item in an object and sorting the other items first in relation to the random pick. Then it uses that random number as
    the pivot/dividing point, making everything before it one list and everything after it another list. It sorts each 'sublist', then returns the final list of the first sublist, the pivot, and the second sublist.

Git Branching

1. Give an instance when you would use git branching.
    You would use git branching if you had a finished product of a project but wanted to add more features or make changes. Branching would allow you to have a copy based on the finished product to test on and break while preserving it in its original state.
    
2. What is a pull request?
    A pull request happens when contributors to a project have made proposed changes to the project and are pushing their merges to the main repo for approval by the project owner(s)
